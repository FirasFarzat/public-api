# public-api

npm's public APIs are haphazard, old-fashioned, and scattered. We can and will do better. An internal API was created to handle the needs of [www](https://github.com/npm/newww), but needs some work before it can be publicly released.

This repo is for collecting feature requests and tracking work on this in future. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/npm/public-api/issues).
